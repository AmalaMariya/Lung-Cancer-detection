# Lung-Cancer-detection using Machine Learning
This project aims to detect lung cancer based on patient data using machine learning techniques. By analyzing features such as lifestyle habits, symptoms, and medical history, the model predicts the likelihood of lung cancer, helping with early detection and better treatment planning.

# Technologies Used
1.Python

2.Pandas - Data analysis and preprocessing

3.NumPy - Numerical operations

4.Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization

5.Scikit-learn - Machine learning modeling and evaluation
